This library implements brokerage-agnostic model objects for investment and trading data. Among other benefits, this permits "the same" instruments to be compared _across_ multiple brokers, including positions and trades that span multiple brokers.

This library is part of the [bankroll](https://github.com/bankroll-py) project.
